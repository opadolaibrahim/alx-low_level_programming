## C - Pointers, arrays and strings
## Pointers

Pointers in C allow you to work with memory addresses directly. Learn how to declare, initialize, and use pointers. Explore pointer arithmetic, pointer to functions, and dynamic memory allocation.

## Arrays

Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type. Understand the basics of arrays in C, including array declaration, initialization, and manipulation. Explore multi-dimensional arrays and their practical applications.

## Strings

In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters. Dive into string handling in C, including string manipulation, comparison, and input/output. Learn about C-style strings (null-terminated strings) and library functions for string operations.
