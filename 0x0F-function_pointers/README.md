# C - Function Pointers

## Introduction

This C project is dedicated to exploring and understanding the concept of function pointers in the C programming language. Function pointers are a powerful feature that allows you to create more flexible and dynamic programs by treating functions as data, enabling you to pass functions as arguments to other functions, store them in data structures, and more.
